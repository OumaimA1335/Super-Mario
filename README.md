# 🎮 Super Mario Java Project

## Overview
This project is a Java-based **Super Mario game** developed to demonstrate object-oriented design principles and software design patterns. The game implements multiple design patterns to make the architecture flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Java** – Main programming language  
- **Log4j** – Logging framework for tracking events and debugging  
- **GitHub** – Version control system for managing code  

### Design Patterns Used
- **State Pattern** – To manage the overall game flow (Menu, Playing, Paused, Game Over)  
- **Composite Pattern** – To handle groups of game objects as a single unit  
- **Factory Pattern** – To create different types of enemies and power-ups  
- **Decorator Pattern** – To dynamically add abilities or effects to game objects  

## 📌 Features
- Multiple **game states**: Menu, Playing, Paused, Game Over  
- Smooth transitions between game states using the **State pattern**  
- Dynamic creation of enemies and power-ups via the **Factory pattern**  
- Grouping of game objects (blocks, coins, enemies) using **Composite pattern**  
- Extendable game objects with **Decorator pattern**  
- Logging of game events (collisions, score updates, state changes) using **Log4j**  
- Modular and maintainable code following object-oriented principles  

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **State Pattern:** Controls game behavior depending on current state (Menu, Playing, Paused, Game Over).  
- **Composite Pattern:** Represents game levels as a tree of objects (blocks, coins, enemies).  
- **Factory Pattern:** Creates enemies and power-ups without exposing instantiation logic.  
- **Decorator Pattern:** Adds new abilities or effects to game objects dynamically.  
- **Log4j:** Logs important game events, errors, and debug messages for monitoring and debugging.
